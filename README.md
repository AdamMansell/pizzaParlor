# Adam Mansell's Pizza Parlor Project

### HTML, CSS, & JS Friday Project for Epicodus, 8/28/2020

## **By Adam Mansell**

## Description
This project contains an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a scripts.js file. By Using these files I was able to create my Pizza Parlor webpage which offers the users some choices of pizza size, and various toppings. After the user selects their prefered pizza, the program will print the total cost to the screen.

## Setup
Clone this repository.

Open the project files in your text editor.

To view a file in the browser:

Right click one file at a time & copy it's path.

Open your prefered internet browser and paste the file path to view the file.
(If using mac, after pasting link in search bar, check for "file" dropdown option before hitting return).
